![logo](./img/azure.svg)

This lab provides a hands-on experience with Azure Portal and gives a quick overlook of portal navigation.

# Azure Foundations & Management
## Getting started with the Azure portal

# Overview
Microsoft Azure is a multi-tenant, public cloud computing platform. It is designed for building, deploying, and managing applications and services through a global network of Microsoft-managed datacenters. It provides SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and supports many different programming languages, tools, and frameworks, including both Microsoft and third-party software and systems.

In this lab, we will be focusing on the Azure foundation. The following topics/objectives will be covered:
* Portals and Navigation
* Accounts, Subscriptions, and Usage
* Classic vs. Resource Manager

# Portals and Navigation

* The portal is a central place to deploy and manage Azure resources. It is a comprehensive marketplace that allows the user to browse through thousands of items from Microsoft (and others) that can be purchased and/or provisioned on the Azure cloud platform.
* The portal provides a unified and scalable browser experience that makes it easy to find resources that can be used to perform various management operations.
* The portal contains management web pages (referred to as **blades**) including settings, actions, billing information, health monitoring, usage data, and other configuration options that the user can manage.
* The portal provides a customizable experience that allows the user to create a dashboard that will display information that is important to the individual user. Some settings and options (which are displayed as tiles ) that can be displayed on the dashboard can include:
  * **All resources** (displays deployed resources in all subscriptions by default)
  * **Service health** (displays the availability status of the Azure datacenters)
  * **Help + support** (Log support tickets and connect to the support community)
  * **Marketplace** (browse Microsoft and third-party offerings to purchase and/or provision in Azure)
  * **Settings** (set default preferences for dashboard color, subscription filter, language settings, and more)

### Capabilities or components used in this scenario:
* Azure: Azure Resource Manager (ARM)

# Lab Conclusion:
This lab provided an overview of the ARM portal to familiarize you with the basic elements of the portal. The links below provide further information:
* To learn more about the ARM portal, click the following link: [Azure Resource Manager Portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/azure-portal/)
* The above scenarios were completed using the ARM portal. However, there are still some management activities that can only be performed in the Azure Service Manager (ASM) portal, also known as the "Classic" portal. For a comparison of ASM arm ARM, click the following link: [ASM vs ARM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model)
